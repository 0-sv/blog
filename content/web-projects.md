## BuT i ThOuGhT yOu WeRe SuPpOsEd tO bE a ClOuD eNgInEer

I've been learning web development since March 2020. Allegedly, it contradicts the linear narrative of the career of a (freelance) cloud engineer. "A specialist in IT should only focus on his specialty" is the common sense, because, generally, one cannot be a jack-of-all-trades. 

However, I don't think that's necessarily true. Web development is an integral part of cloud infrastructure. Every project that's built on AWS and Kubernetes for example, can be seen as a web project. More so for enterprise projects.

I don't think it's reasonable to call myself a "full-stack" engineer and also a cloud engineer, because there are only 144 hours in a week. So I'm sticking with my specialty in cloud infrastructure, however, for enterprise clients, I still want to be knowledgeable on what we're building, mainly to see the whole picture. I will just hobby along and use these projects as a "base case" for building cloud infrastructure. 

More specifically, I will use candidate projects for building a "DevOps" infrastructure for my article series. Not every project is going to be quite interesting to build on top of Kubernetes and AWS, so it's probably going to involve more serious projects. In either case, see these projects in a line of upwards progression.
