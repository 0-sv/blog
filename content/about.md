Hi, my name is Sebastiaan Verbeek. sv@work is an abbreviation of the first letter of my first name and last name. The @work part is for dedicating it as a career profile.

[I've written a blog post about my work experience and projects so far.]({{< ref "/posts/career-lessons.md" >}})

Plans to move to the public cloud? I'm giving out free consultation for the first 30 minutes.
