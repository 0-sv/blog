Hi, my name is Sebastiaan Verbeek. sv@work is an abbreviation of the first letter of my first name and last name. The @work part is for dedicating it as a career profile.

[I've written a blog post about my work experience and projects so far.]({{< ref "/posts/career-lessons.md" >}})

I'm accepting projects to solve the problem of making your application elastic. That is, expanding and contracting your application to ensure you have the right amount of compute. Some of the problems you will run into when operating in the cloud:

- Elastic design
- Unpredictable costs (ever paid for a DDoS?)
- Hidden expenses
- Paying for a lot of services
- Forgetting to clean up resources
- Vendor lock-in
- Thinking you can build a more reliable infrastructure than AWS

Trust me, it's not as easy as it looks. But here's what I'm offering. Even if we find out we're not a mutual fit, I'll do my best to help you on your way and find a suitable partner.

What's the catch? I'm all-in on the philosophy of adding value first and billing later. I would rather spend two hours to help you out first and show you how valuable I am, than trying to suck you into a partnership you'd like to get out of.

Feel free to contact me for a free consultation. We can chat for 10 minutes or two hours, whatever you need right now.
