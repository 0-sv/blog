I've started doing freelance cloud engineering since the end of 2018. During software engineering at my first full-time employer, I was invited to work on a start-up. At one point the money ran out, so I went to look for a new employer in 2019. There, I worked on system administration during the time DevOps and Cloud were becoming trending. 

I took a break for a while to travel, and had some time to think about what direction to head. I think it's a good practice to think about the direction you want to go in before you put in the work, because you can get anywhere you want but you might end up somewhere you don't like.

Now, in April 2020, I feel comfortable going into cloud engineering knowing that it's the right choice for the upcoming years. 

Here's a recap of my project experience:

## Software Engineer at Ellips

It was quite exciting getting hired as a software engineer since I majored in law and did computer science on the side. Nevertheless, my C++ implementation of binary search was enough to have them excited as well. The projects I worked on: 

- Working in Agile Scrum; 
- Writing C# front-end in a model-view-controller pattern;
- Writing C++/Lua (computer vision) back-end;
- Automated deployment of TFS build agents. 

## Data Architect at Hydrotronics

Hydrotronics had an interesting proposition as a B2B SaaS provider with spa automation back-end. I also got back into consulting after failing running a company two years ago.

For this project, I would be in charge of data engineering on AWS. We worked in a team of five; everyone had loads of experience and high expectations of me. Moreover, there were technical barriers between the team members since everyone knew their own niche well but it was hard to figure out how one part would fit in the other. 

If we could repeat the project, I would bargain for getting investments before developing the product. Then it wouldn't be necessary to pay for the development of the product out-of-pocket. Establishing product/market fit before developing the project is a great way to attract capital. In the end, the assumption that this model would sell itself was only the "logical conclusion" of how much this product would be in demand. Needless to say, a better way would have been to base that decision on data. 

Like I mentioned, the project didn't work out for me but it's great knowing I was an asset in the following projects:

- Making the architectural design for data engineering on AWS;
- Successfully applying for the Dutch subsidy grant for innovation;
- Financial data modelling for attracting capital.

## Systems Engineer at ACC ICT

In May 2019 I was desperate for money. I was still doing a breadth-first-search of sorts, where I would rather learn wide knowledge rather than deep knowledge. So after working at an enterprise shop and a start-up, doing a whole other aspect of IT called "system administration" seemed quite interesting. Furthermore, after keeping up with studies I began to feel more comfortable writing code and making decisions. You could tell by the following projects:

- CI/CD implementation in Jenkins/Ansible for configuring Kubernetes clusters;
- CI/CD implementation in Jenkins/Ansible for deploying microservices.

I figured that as a private cloud provider with WYSIWYG Kubernetes clusters, there should at least be automation in place so we could roll out Kubernetes clusters in a decent amount of time. It would be a strange proposition to perform these manually, since there are loads of cloud offering where you can roll out your own cluster with a few clicks. 

## Taking A Break

For my break starting in December 2019, I flew to Tasmania. I've explored the island and that was enough Australia for me. I spent a month in Bali where I studied for AWS CCP (besides having fun of course). 

Now, I knew that I wanted to come back to Hanoi because two years ago when I studied CS in Singapore I spent some time in Vietnam. So it seemed like the perfect choice, and I flew to Hanoi in February. I was planning to start teaching English, but those plans have been cut short for now due to the Corona virus. At least while sitting at home, I had time to study and achieve the CNCF CKA. 

## Company Attempt Number Three

In January 2020 I also registered the company "sv@work" in the Dutch Chamber of Commerce. In the next two months, I signed on two clients who were my previous employers. One employer is ACC ICT and the other is a law firm specializing in health care law. 

It took me until April to realize, after studying about freelancing and entrepreneurship, that it's quite important to select a niche. You see, people only think about other people in terms of their top capability. Like in medieval times, you know Joe is a proper blacksmith and Maria does excellent clothes repair.

Besides that, to actually help a client you should already have the solution in place. The idea is to know one solution so well, you could perform it with your eyes closed. (This solution should of course have product/market fit, ie. there's a clear demand for this kind of solution. This lack of information is probably the hardest part about proper execution of a starting company. Now for me, as a developer, there shouldn't be a lack of demand for cloud engineering solutions.)

This is one of my mistakes for this year. I assumed that it would be enough to sell a client on my time. But no, you can only help a client with some arbitrary problem if and only if you have a system in place for solving that problem.

Let's assume you know one solution well. The next step would be to find your clients: where are they? Obviously, in the digital era it's become easier to match supply and demand. Let's say they're on an arbitrary social media platform.

We want to have a conversation with those people; now for me, this is where the focus will be in 2020. As an employer, you'd ideally have contractors that have their area of expertise with the lowest possible risk to execute on the company vision. For me, there's a lack of demonstrating that value, so I might have to go find a job after all. I found out about this while doing some interviews for contracting positions. 

Anyway, while I find a solution to pay the bills, in the meantime, if I want to succeed as a freelancer, I should demonstrate value by writing articles about my technology stack and subsequent projects.
